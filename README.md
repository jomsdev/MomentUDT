# libMoment

*libMoment* is a *C++* library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. It is heavely inspired in a Javascript library called [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/).

This library is an exemple for people who want to learn how to use the type system of *C++*, learning it from a real world example.
The **type system** in *C++* is very powerful and I have not seen many people using it. Using the features of *C++* can help us to **write better, safer and faster code**.asdfas
